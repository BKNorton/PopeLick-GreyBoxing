# PopeLick-GreyBoxing
DESCRIPTION:
	
	This is the code that I have created for my video game, "Pope Lick" so far. This code will not work on its own. It is connected to a Unity project and requires the project to run. This repository is on here just to demonstrate my C# knowledge to potential employers. This project currently uses Unity's built in version controller formerly know as Plastic. I am in the process right now of creating a website to showcase the features of this project.



FEATURE LIST:

      - First Person Character controller that can;
          - move, look, run, jump, crouch, quickturn
          
      - An Input System that records user input (compatible with multiple input devices) 
      
      - An interactive system that allows the player to interact with other objects in different ways, including opening drawers, turning on switches, and anything else we need the           player to do
      - A UI that includes;
      
          - crosshairs that change when player is looking at an interactable object and 
          - displays a text prompt to imform the player of the action they can perform.
          - main menu
          - camera UI
      - A Camera System that allows the player to take pictures in the game and develop them into a photo to be later used to progress the players investigation.
      
      - An inventory system that allows the player to pick up items and display them and allow the player to manage items in inventory
      
      - Player animations



INSTRUCTIONS: 

      Again this code on its own does nothing and is only on here to demonstrate my knowledge in C# for potential employers. A website to showcase the actual functionality of this game is in the works and I will include a link in this README when it is completed. Check back shortly for the link.
